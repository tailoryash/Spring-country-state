# Spring-country-state

In this spring project I made for managing country and state details like CRUD operation in Mysql.

Index.jsp --> 
1)Add details of country
2)Edit details of country
3)Delete details of country

4)Add details of state
5)Edit details of state
6)Delete details of state

You can also view Database of country and state table from viewCountry.jsp and viewState.jsp

Here, I used MySQL database for relational database for Country and State table
countryID is foreign for state table
